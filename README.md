# AresApplication
The idea of the project is to develop and implement a basic 3D scene using the framework Unity3D/ C# and another application developed in C++ to interface the Unity application and control a player inside the scene. The player inside the game should have the ability to move around the scene with the behavior of a vehicle and contain a weapon system capable of rotating 360º and elevation control. Upon start up of the scene, targets shall be spawned in random positions of the scenario and move in loop according to predefined movements patterns. The player shall be controlled by the application in C++ and use its weapon system to fire at targets placed on the scene.
